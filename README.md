# Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree Udacity Projects
## Repository for my work on the Udacity DL Nanodegree projects.
- The 5 projects requested in the program are done! \o/
- For now, the projects contain only the implementation for the "TODOS" in the original notebooks provided by Udacity repository (https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning)
- In the future, they will include improvements recommended in the reviews (through tutorials, papers and more advanced techniques) and also experiments of my own.
- Upcoming 6th project in Reinforcement Learning: Quadcopter controller.
