# Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree Udacity Projects
## Repository for the Udacity DL Nanodegree projects.
- The 5 projects requested in the program are already done.
- For now, the projects contain only the implementation for the "TODOS" in the original notebooks provided by [Udacity repository] (https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning)
- With time, they will include improvements recommended in the reviews (through tutorials, papers and more advanced techniques) and also experiments of my own.
- Upcoming 6th project in Reinforcement Learning: Quadcopter controller.
